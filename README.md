# PyMorseEncoder
A CLI tool that translates text into Morse Code and back.
This was also the first Python project I developed fully in NeoVim, and I am still struggling with the DAP, which delayed the process quite a bit.

## Tests
Tests are barely started, as this was the first time trying to use pytest, which I basically only did after the app was "finished".
Good learning, though.
